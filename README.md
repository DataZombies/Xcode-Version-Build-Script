# Xcode Version-Build Script
Adding this script to your project turns the Version and Build numbers from this...

...to this...

...when building or archiving.
##Installing the Script
To install the script select the project's target.

![./img/img3.png](./img/img3.png)

Click the ```Build Phases``` tab. If you don't see the ```Run Script``` section click ```+``` in the Standard Editor's top left corner and select ```New Run Script Phase``` in the popup menu.

Expand the ```Run Script``` section. Verify that ```/bin/sh``` is in the ```Shell``` text field. Replace the ```Type a script or drag a script file from your workspace to insert its path``` sentence with the contents of the ```Xcode Version-Build Script.txt```. The ```Run Script``` section should look like the following. (Well, not quite. The script may have been updated in which case I'm not going to do a new screen shot with the new version.)

When you build the app for the simulator or a device the build number will be incremented. When you archive the app for iTunes Connect or Enterpirse Distribution the Version number will be incremented (1.0 &#8658; 1.1) and the build number will be reset to 0.

***One caveat***. The Version and Build numbers are incremented **after** the build or achive. Begin your new project with Build 0.

##Using Version & Build Numbers in Code
###Swift
```
self.lblVersion.text = String(format: "Version: %@", (NSBundle.mainBundle().infoDictionary?["CFBundleShortVersionString"] as? String)!);

self.lblBuild.text = String(format: "Build: %@", (NSBundle.mainBundle().infoDictionary?["CFBundleVersion"] as? String)!);
```
###Objective-C

```
self.lblVersion.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Version: %@", [[NSBundle mainBundle] objectForInfoDictionaryKey:@"CFBundleShortVersionString"]];

self.lblBuild.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Build: %@", [[NSBundle mainBundle] objectForInfoDictionaryKey:@"CFBundleVersion"]];
```
